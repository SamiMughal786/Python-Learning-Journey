# Sami's Python Learning Journey 🐍
> Welcome to my personal repository for documenting my journey of learning Python from scratch. This space will contain all my practice code, small projects, and notes as I progress day by day.

The main goal is to build a solid foundation in Python, track my progress publicly, and connect with the developer community. Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or suggest improvements!

## My Goals

- [ ] Master the fundamentals of Python (variables, data types, loops, functions, etc.).
- [ ] Understand and implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- [ ] Build several small to medium-sized projects.
- [ ] Get comfortable using Git and GitHub for version control.
- [ ] Contribute to an open-source project.


## Connect with Me

I'm sharing my progress and connecting with other developers. Let's connect!
